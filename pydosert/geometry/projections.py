    """
    Compute the fractional overlap of a pixel with a 1-D box aperture.

    All inputs must be in the same physical units (mm).  The pixel centred at
    ``d`` spans ``[d - pixel_size/2,  d + pixel_size/2]``.  The aperture spans
    ``[left, right]``.

    The effective aperture is extended by ``pixel_size/2`` on each side so
    that a pixel whose centre coincides with ``left`` or ``right`` receives a
    50 % fractional overlap.  This means the 50 % crossing of the rendered
    step-function aperture is at ``left - pixel_size/2`` and
    ``right + pixel_size/2`` — i.e. half a pixel *outside* the nominal leaf
    position.
